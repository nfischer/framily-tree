## What is this?

This is an interactive family tree for my fraternity. This shows family lineage
while also allowing users to interact to better navigate and understand the
history:

 * Change color coding to organize the tree by family, pledge class, or members'
   active status
 * Use the search function to quickly find particular fraternity members in the
   tree
 * Play around with graph nodes (they bounce around and collide with each other
   using a physics engine!)

This family tree is entirely data-driven and easy to update. Data is pulled from
a [google spreadsheet].

## How does it work?

Check out the [design overview](https://github.com/nfischer/framily-tree/wiki/Design).

## Maintaining this family tree

Updating the data? Adding new members to the tree? See the instructions
[here](https://github.com/nfischer/framily-tree/wiki/Updating-data-(adding-new-members)).
